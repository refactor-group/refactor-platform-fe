# refactor-platform-fe Project Instructions

## Mandatory File Consultations

**Code Implementation/Editing** → Read `.claude/coding-standards.md` FIRST
**Pull Request Operations** → Read `.claude/pr-instructions.md` FIRST

## Rules
- Project standards override global defaults on conflict
- Validate all code against standards before task completion
- PR reviews require both files if coding standards referenced
