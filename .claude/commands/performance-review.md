Review this Next.js/React/TypeScript code for performance and architectural issues:

**PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
- Unnecessary re-renders and missing memoization
- Bundle size and code splitting effectiveness
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- API call efficiency and caching
- Static generation vs SSR usage

**REACT BEST PRACTICES**
- Component size and complexity (max 200-300 lines)
- JSX markup length (max 50 lines per return)
- Proper use of hooks and lifecycle
- State management patterns
- Effect cleanup and dependency arrays

**NEXT.JS PATTERNS**
- Appropriate rendering strategy (SSG/SSR/CSR/ISR)
- Proper use of App Router vs Pages Router
- API route design and middleware usage
- Font and asset optimization

**TYPESCRIPT USAGE**
- Type safety and avoiding 'any'
- Interface vs type usage
- Proper generic implementations
- Strict mode compliance

**ARCHITECTURE**
- Separation of concerns
- Component composition patterns
- Custom hook extraction
- Service layer organization
