# AI Transcription Tab Prototype

A standalone UI prototype for the AI transcription/insights feature.

## Setup

```bash
cd prototype
npm install
```

## Running

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Notes

- This is a self-contained Vite + React app with Tailwind CSS
- The prototype is in `src/ai-transcription-tab.jsx`
- All data is mocked - no backend required
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ is recommended (though it works with 21.x with warnings)
